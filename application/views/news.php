							<h1>Two faces are better than one</h1>
							<h3><u>Walrus Audio’s Janus fuzz/trem is a double threat of the best kind.</u></h3>
							<p>Oklahoma-based Walrus Audio has unleashed a series of successful dirt/fuzz stomps in their year or so in the business. The summer 2012 launch of the flagship Voyager pedal was followed by the Iron Horse distortion, Jupiter fuzz, Deep Six compressor and the Mayflower overdrive. All of these releases were classic, no-nonsense tone tools that
							</p><img src="/images/news/tab7.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
							<p>earned the company early respect in online gear circles. In between the release of the Deep Six and Mayflower, Walrus did something a bit more left of center. Co-founder Brady Smith had teased images of sketches featuring a dual joystick-controlled pedal, but most figured the stomp was a custom, one-off... but it wasn’t. It was, in fact, a new entry to the Walrus line-up.
							</p>
							<p>Dubbed the Janus, the pedal is a true bypass Tremolo/Fuzz pedal that allows the user to create a texture-ladened landscape of distorted tones. Both the Tremolo and the Fuzz can be isolated and used alone, but can also be used together in series creating a diverse set of widely-varying sounds built around tasty fuzz tones or silky trem pulses.
							</p>
							<p>Controls on the Janus include a pair of joysticks that each sport separate X and Y axis that have designated controls. The Tremolo joystick controls the rate and depth while the Fuzz joystick controls the amount of fuzz and the tone. There are also individual Level knobs to control output and a Blend knob on the fuzz side that allows the mixing of an unaffected signal with the effected fuzz signal. A Mode mini-toggle switches between arrangements of clipping diodes to create various fuzz tones. The Bass mini-toggle activates a bass boost when switched left.
							</p>
							<p>Plugged in, the Janus is 100% fun. With just about any guitar pickup variation, you will be able to run the gamut from tasteful trem textures to pulsing, swirling wall o’ fuzz mayhem with just a few clicks and joystick redirects. The joystick controls make the Janus a great option for vocals and keys too, but they do make things a challenge to recall particular settings. While you can set-it-and-forget-it with the pedal, the Janus is more at home as an adjust on-the-fly sonic stew. Priced at $289, the two pedals-in-one Janus is a heck of a deal for any noise merchant who likes a little flutter with their fuzz.

							<h1>Take it fuzz-y</h1>
							<h3><u>The TSVG Slow Ride offers a rewarding trip down a dirt road.</u></h3>
							<p>Philadelphia-based TSVG (or Trolley Square Vintage Guitar) Pedals has only been putting out product since 2012. First, the builder concentrated on smaller run, hand-painted offerings like the Tremolowl to test the market for its take on certain classic wider-release, branded stomps, like the Hard Stuff boost.  </p>
							<img src="/images/news/tab3.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">

							<p>It didn’t take long for the web community to take notice of the up and comer. One of the company’s most recent releases is a germanium-based OD/fuzz dubbed ‘Slow Ride’... the fourth Ge-fueled stomp in the young company’s expanding line behind the popular Angry Jeff, Babbling Flower and Keystone pedals.</p>
							 <p>The Slow Ride is cut from the classic Fuzz Face cloth, but it can manage overdrive tones and has an extra control that affects bass response. Controls on the pedal are straight-forward - two knobs (Volume and Attack) and a toggle. The toggle is a ‘thickening agent’ according to the builder. It acts as a high-end filter. In the down position it allows the user full signal to pass. In the up position the switch feeds more body into the signal.</p>
							 <p>A peek inside shows the hand-wired circuit (with cloth-covered wire no less) and AC128 transistors... which some believe were in the earliest iterations of the Fuzz Face. (They were definitely used in the Fuzz Face reissues that were available in the early 2000s.)</p>
							 <p>With the push of our Les Paul’s humbuckers, the Slow Ride gives you that woolly bloom one might expect when cranked, but you don’t have to dime the Gain control in order to get some fairly aggressive drive tones. In fact, even with the Gain rolled full left the Slow Ride gives you plenty of dirty push. The clean-up is better at lower output levels, but never really gets you to any kind of sparkle. </p>
							 <p>Switching to the single coils of a Strat, the Slow Ride muscles up the grit and provides solid drive tones with the Gain near zero. Rolling up the Gain control and switching to the neck pick-up offers some thick, fuzzy and rounded tones for solo work that howls.  </p>
							 <p>The company’s mantra goes something like this... ‘We believe every circuit is a work of art.’... and with art comes subjectivity. This TSVG build is not revolutionary, but it is solid. Getting any kind of hand-built, point-to-point boutique pedal in the $200 range is a find in its own right... and when it can provide a versatile and usable tone suite like the Slow Ride, all the better. </p>

							<h3><u>Hovercraft kickstarts the Ionostrofear... and we’re frightened.</u></h3>
							<p>Hovercraft Amps is a relative newcomer to the boutique MI scene, but its principle is not. Nial McGaughey is well known as the man behind Solid Cables, so it was not a complete shock to see him - a relentless tinkerer - spreading out into other areas of the business. Late last year, Nial put up a Kickstarter campaign for a short run of a new fuzz</p>
							<img src="/images/news/tab4.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
							<p>pedal dubbed Icarus. That name, however, was taken (by Caroline Guitar Co. for its boost pedal), so Nial stepped back briefly and rebranded the stomp the Ionostrofear.
							</p>
							<p>The campaign was a success. A goal of $1,000 was surpassed... then doubled... then tripled... until, when time expired, Nial had received pledges approaching $6,000. The pedals made their way out to backers over the course of January.
							</p>
							<p>The Ionostrofear sports three knob controls - Volume, Tone and Gain. The Gain can take you anywhere from lo-fi crunch all the way to crazied modulation. The Tone control is also capable of bringing in loads of highs due to the very bassy nature of the fuzz.
							</p>
							<p>With single coils, the Ionostrofear can still give off a pretty thick wall of snarl. Rolling on the Fuzz control starts to introduce a fair amount of glitch and artifacts that you can have fun with via the pick-up selector. With the humbuckers on our Les Paul, the pedal was capable of lo-fi rumble at lower Volume settings. Rolling up both the Volume and Fuzz brings in a molasses-thick coating of fuzz that would do any stoner rock fan proud. Keep turning right and you end up with a gated, spitting fuzz that moves more unpredictably and thus is a bit harder to control. The glitch tones are also there.
							</p>
							<p>In the crowded boutique fuzz market where a lot of releases sound alike, the Ionostrofear offers two key elements beyond sound that pedal buyers love... a cool name and a unique look. The Ionostrofear’s sound isn’t revolutionary, but rather an evolution of the glitch-capable wall of fuzz. The pedal is no one trick pony. It can achieve more usable tones than many of the noise-maker fuzzes on the market.
							</p>
							<p>While the Kickstarter pedals are long gone, Nial is planning a general release soon. At $135 for the production version of the Ionostrofear, fuzz fiends should check it out.

							<h1>The Tolling of the Iron Bell</h1>
							<h3><u>Mojo Hand FX offers up a new take on the Gilmour lead tone.</u></h3>
							<p>The crew at Texas-based Mojo Hand FX are no strangers to fuzz. Heck, just in the past few months, the prolific pedal purveyors have launched three new fuzzes as part of their 2012 release slate - the One Ton Bee (a Mosrite Fuzzrite tribute), Crosstown (a Fuzz Face variant with hybrid circuitry) and now the Iron Bell - a Big Muff platformer that aims </p>
							<img src="/images/news/tab6.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
							<p>to capture the allusive David Gilmour/Pink Floyd lead tone or at least get the player in
							the neighborhood. The Iron Bell certainly is not the first pedal to set its sights on the Gilmour tone. Skreddy has produced several Muff variants that play in that sand box. Others have offered tweaked Muff variants that profess to land you in the same territory. Mojo Hand has said the Iron Bell was designed to get the user close to both Gilmour’s early Fuzz Face tones as well as the guitarist’s later ‘Ram’s Head’ and ‘Triangle’ Big Muff sonics.
							</p>
							<p>The Iron Bell, named for a lyric from Pink Floyd’s ‘Time’, sports four knob controls - Tone, Gain, Colour and Volume. Gain and Volume are self-explanatory, while Colour and Tone act as an EQ of sorts adding to the overall tonal palette of the pedal. 
							</p>
							<p>One of the first things that is noticeable about the Iron Bell is that it does not take much gain to get you some fairly rich sustain, even with the pedal’s lower gain transistors. Into a slightly overdriven amp, the Iron Bell is capable of soaring, crisp lead lines, without the swampiness that can bog down so many other Big Muff-styled fuzzes. Another thing that is clear about the Iron Bell is its handling of string definition and pick attack. 
							</p>
							<p>Whether with humbuckers or single coils, the Iron Bell maintains tight textures - even at higher gain settings - and the ability to hear all notes in an arpeggiated riff without compromising the bottom end.
							</p>
							<p>We think of the Iron Bell is the upper-class uncle of the Mojo Hand Colossus fuzz. The two are definitely related, but the Bell is richer and more refined. 
							</p>
							<p>If you’re looking for a Dinosaur Jr. type, wall of sound Big Muff, look elsewhere... but if you need a tasty fuzz that can tackle a good range of low to mid ‘wool’ challenges - and, of course, Floyd-esque lead lines -  the Iron Bell tolls for thee.

							<h1>Spin Cycle</h1>
							<h3><u>Option 5’s rotating speaker pedal is a trip</u></h3>
							<p>The crew at Option 5 set out to capture the sought-after tones of a single, spinning speaker with the Destination Rotation Single. The pedal looks to supply the luxury of a Vibratone/ Leslie-style simulation to those unable to afford the genuine article (or to move a real one due to back problems!).
							</p><img src="/images/news/tab10.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
							<p>The pedal boasts eight controls in a rather small footprint including Mic Placement knob, which effects the intensity of the effect - Slow Trim, Fast Trim and Drive Level mini-knobs - Drive Amount knob, and Fast/Slow, On/Off and Overdrive footswitches. 
							</p>
							<p>The DRS offers up some sweet analog chorus and vibe tones that can go from clean and crisp to growling and lush via the Overdrive controls. The Overdrive Amount introduces gain into the signal, while the Drive Level mini-knob keeps the signal loud even when you back off the Drive Amount. The Fast/Slow switch allows the user to have a pair of unique speeds set up to toggle between if desired, which comes in handy in a live setting. Switching between them prompts a gradual speed up/slowdown of the effect.
							</p>
							<p>At around $269, the DRS is one of the more affordable spinning speaker sims out there... and worth every penny.

							<h1>RAPTOR RAPTURE</h1>
							<h3><u>The EarthQuaker Devices Talons is a full-featured overdrive with something for everyone.</u></h3>
							<p>JAMIE STILLMAN and the team at EarthQuaker Devices have long been a favorite of those pedal fanatics across the globe attracted to top flight quality at an affordable price. Earlier this year at Summer NAMM, EarthQuaker showcased three upcoming releases 
							</p><img src="/images/news/tab9.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
							<p>- the reissue Crimson Drive, a new version of the Hoof Reaper fuzz and the Talons overdrive. Talons is a full-range overdrive that is designed to cover tone from straight clean boost all the way to neighborhood of modern rock distortion.
							</p>
							<p>The Talons has been a long-term project for the Akron, Ohio-based pedal maker. After a solid 12-month period of prototyping various incarnations of the stomp and fine-tuning the voicing, the Talons is on the cusp of being released to the public.
							</p>
							<p>The drive sports six knob controls - Level, Presence, Drive, Treble, Middle and Bass. The Presence control is an extra tone shaper on top of the active EQ, which allows additional tweakability to Talons’ already broad sonic palette. 
							</p>
							<p>According to Stillman, it was not inspired by one specific sound or meant to emulate any particular vintage amp tone. Instead, the goal was to make the a rangey drive pedal that was unlike any other overdrive in the company’s line.  Mission accomplished.
							</p>
							<p>The Talons overdrive is a crunch factory of earthy, spacious tones that treat varying pickup arrays to a wide push of sizzle and growl. 
							</p>
							<p>At its higher gain settings with humbuckers, the pedal gets almost beastly and while not full-on metal chugga, it will get you to the modern hard rock neighborhood with ease, treating the user with loads of tasty sustain.
							</p>
							<p>Armed with a Telecaster, we were able to achieve a beefy growl with mid-gain settings using the bridge pickup. 
							</p>
							<p>The Tele also took to the Talons’ higher gain levels well while maintaining good string definition.
							</p>
							<p>With the single coils of a Stratocaster, the Talons excels at offering low gain tones that really beef up the neck pickup, making bluesy solo work pop.
							</p>
							<p>The Talons is wider in scope than the EarthQuaker Devices White Light (another favorite) while throatier than its Dirt Transmitter, and not as dark as the Monarch. The addition of the active EQ really opens up the tone sculpting possibilities - think Dr. Scientist’s The Elements for a tweakability comparison. 
							</p>
							<p>Once you dial in the gain and EQ settings to your liking, the edge can be rolled on or off by using the Presence knob.
							</p>
							<p>There are sweet spots aplenty across the gain spectrum of the Talons, but don’t be afraid to use all six knobs on the pedal to explore the full range. This is not a set-it-and-forget-it overdrive. 
							</p>
							<p>The Talons begs to be tweaked... leading to different, but always delightful, results.

							<h3><u>Strymon’s Mobius is a modulation celebration</u></h3>
							<p>With the release of the Mobius, it is clear that the DSP demons at Strymon are far from finished having their way with your sonic sensibilities. The Mobius, which inherits the same form factor as its sibling Timeline delay pedal, is packed with more syrupy swirl than your local sno-cone hut... a result of the Strymon crew’s meticulous manipulation </p>
							<img src="/images/news/tab5.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
							<p>of its favored SHARC DSP. Much of what the Mobius has to offer descends directly from Strymon’s existing line of modulation effects, including the Ola chorus, Orbit flanger, Flint tremolo/reverb and Lex rotary speaker simulator. In all, the Mobius gives the user access to a dozen unique modulation machines ranging from vintage-voiced Chorus and Vibe effects to more modern bits and bleeps. 
							</p>
							<p>The top panel highlights include a Type knob to guide the player through each of the machines of the Mobius, conventional Speed, Depth and Level knob controls as well as a pair of assignable Parameter knobs that can  be saved per the pedal’s preset function. The Value knob allows for the navigation of each machines’ assignable parameters (viewable via the pedal’s LED display). The pedal gives player the option to save and recall up to 200 presets that can be banked through via a pair of the pedal’s trio of foot switches. 
							</p>
							<p>Along the back panel, the Mobius sports stereo in and outs, an expression pedal jack that can be assigned control of any knob or combination of knobs, a Pre/Post switch that allows the pedal to be placed in two different locations along a mono signal chain, and MIDI in/out.
							</p>
							<p>The initial scroll through the mod machines of the Mobius can be a bit daunting, but hang with it and be rewarded by the sheer extensiveness of the pedal’s palette. Volume and variety are one thing, but quality is what most folks who drop $400-plus on a pedal want delivered, and the Mobius does. Rolling through the pedal’s machine types for the first time, it’s easy to be struck by the chorus, which is Ola all the way... the Rotary, which does the Lex ‘Leslie’ spin thing... the Vibe, which holds its own on the liquid spectrum, Formant, which is an articulate talker, and ambient-capable Quadrature. The Filter can get you several flavors of sweep, good for getting the funk out, as well as the ability to dial up a respectable cocked wah tone. The tremolos are solid. It’s not the spot- on vintage amp trem everyone longs for in a  box, but it gets you in the neighborhood.
							</p>
							<p>Drilling down into the Mobius is where the real power is unlocked. For every machine has its own set of sub-voices. These voices have their own sets of tweakable parameters. For example, the Phaser has seven unique modes. Each mode has access to four separate parameters - Regen, Waveshape, Headroom and Spread (for stereo configurations). Two of these parameters - Waveshape and Spread - have multiple voice and time settings. It doesn’t take long to realize you can slip down the rabbit hole with the Mobius, much like the Timeline. Don’t be afraid however, the controls are intuitive and if you are familiar at all with the Timeline, or the host of other digital multi-effect boxes on the market, it should take no time for you to get used to navigating the Mobius. If you do find yourself overwhelmed by the offerings with the Mobius, never fear. Not only is there a fairly comprehensive user manual available, Strymon recently made a PDF of the pedal’s voluminous preset settings available. If you find a preset you like, but would like to tweak it a bit, now you’ll have the proper starting point.
							</p>
							<p>The Mobius is everything you have come to expect from Strymon. It’s digital. It’s thorough. And it’s capable of creating some of the sweetest swirl this side of Dairy Queen. While ease-of-use and price may be a factor in would-be users shying away from the pedal, we think those who take the plunge will be pleasantly surprised... and get their money’s worth.

							<h3><u>The Diamond Pedals Quantum Leap is a compact dervish of mondo modulation.</u></h3>
							<p>When the Quantum Leap debuted at the Winter NAMM show in January, we distinctly remember telling Diamond Pedals’ director of operations Aimish Wallace that he should prepare to sell a boat-load of them. Ok, our specific comment was a bit more blue, but
							</p><img src="/images/news/tab8.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">
							<P>you get the picture... and judging by the level of internet chatter, many of you have also gotten the Quantum Leap.
							</P>
							<P>A sort of cousin to the company’s popular Memory Lane Jr. delay, the Quantum Leap is actually several effects - flanger, chorus, filter and delay - housed in one compact enclosure and moved between by the self-centering Mode toggle. The pedal’s other controls operate as one would think in the individual modes. The Quantum Leap also sports a Tap/FX footswitch that can set the LFO speeds or delay times as well as access other special FX functions. The tap rate resets once you go back to the knob control.
							</P>
							<P>Exploring mode by mode, it’s clear the Quantum Leap offers a ton of useful modulation, whether you’re after just a touch of delay, peripheral ambience or more aggressive warbles. In Flange mode, the Quantum Leap offers a nice sweep range. The ‘yowls’ are defined, if a touch thin at lower Width settings. The Chorus of the pedal is a winner, capable of everything from subtle washes to rapid trem-like pulsing.
							</P>
							<P>Filter mode was our least favorite, but by no means a dud. We were able to lock in a fairly sweet cocked wah tone with ease.
							</P>
							<P>The Tap Delay is very nice and shows off the pedal’s Memory Lane Jr. lineage. Rotating the Width knob right brings in the modulation - from a hint at left, to a flood full right. The Pitch Ramp Delay mode is just as it sounds. It gives the user the ability to ramp the pitch of trailing notes by holding down the Tap/FX switch. First hold ramps up... second hold ramps down. A quick tap will return you to the original pitch.
							</P>
							<P>The Diamond Quantum leap is a tasty multi-mod effects box in a compact, affordable package. While the pedal’s digital roots or its learning curve may not be for everyone, it is certainly worth the test drive if you are in the market for a swirl factory.
